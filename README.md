Hey! My name is Remington, I'm a computer/software engineer. I like tinkering with things, gaming, learning new stuff, reading, movies, TV, blah, blah, blah. 🥰


This is my dog Sasha; she was my everything and i miss her so much. 💔 She was my best friend for 12 years and was by my side through the best and worst times of my life. 💕
